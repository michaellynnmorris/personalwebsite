      <description>A collection of thoughts on transportation in cities:
 Busses are underrated. They should be the backbone of urban public transportation. They are cost effective and can change according to demand (frequency and routes). Bus only lanes, preferences at stop lights, better signage with expected wait times and maps, and other measures can make them more effective. The virus makes this more challenging, admittedly, although I’m optimistic that we’ll eventually have some combination of vaccine, protective clothing, and behavioral practices that minimize risk.</description>

      <description>Things I’m curious to read about in the coming years about coronavirus impacts:
 Work related
 Will companies become more friendly to remote work? Will they seek out remote employees as a form of resilience to future disease waves? Will they increase their demand for office space to give their employees more space or decrease their demand as they shift to remote work? Will a home office boost the value of one’s house more than before?</description>
