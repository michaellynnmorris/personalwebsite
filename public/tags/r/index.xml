      <description>The relatively new nflfastR package is pretty incredible. One command and you get a local SQLite database with 20 years of cleaned play by play data:
 update_db( dbdir = “/home/michael/Documents/NFL/”, dbname = “nflpbpdb”, tblname = “pbp_raw”, force_rebuild = FALSE)
 And you can run the same command to update with any new games. Incredible.
Playing around with it, one measure you get is completion percentage above expectation (CPOE), which takes into account the relative difficulty of each throw and the outcomes.</description>

      <description>I’ve recently made available my first public R package. RTHORR is designed to make it easy to run the randomaization test of hypothesized order relations (RTHOR; Hubert &amp;amp; Arabie, 1987). Terence Tracey, who wrote most of the original code, graciously agreed to let me make some minor alterations and turn his code into this package. Please see the link above for installation instructions and more information.</description>
