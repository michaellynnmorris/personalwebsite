      <description>My family and I recently spent a day at Walt Disney World (Magic Kingdom) in Orlando. Here’s what I recommend if you are considering going yourself:
Before you book, strongly consider not going at all. My wife and I agreed after that even though our day went ok, it was a big effort in time and money and it probably wasn’t worth it. There are many other theme parks and places to go.</description>

      <title>Reviewing Kirwan&#39;s predictions 10 years later</title>

      <description>Pat Kirwan’s book with David Seigerman Take Your Eye Off the Ball was published in 2010. There is a second edition, published in 2015, but I’m focusing on a series of predictions made in the original in Chapter 14 (State of the Art Football).
Here I’ll review his predictions and make some of my own for the next 10 years. No huddle for all. Here Kirwan predicted that the pre play huddle would be phased out, with teams going into the huddle for 10 plays per half.</description>

      <title>NFL draft capital and next year DVOA</title>

      <description>I previously took a look at [draft capital spent from 2010-2019] and [draft capital by team by position] over the same period. Here I will extend that analysis further with the question: Does draft capital spent have an impact on the subsequent year’s performance?
To do that, I’ll look at draft capital spent on offense and defense across the league and predict the following year’s DVOA. Draft capital will once again be determined using the Chase Stuart model.</description>

      <title>NFL draft capital by position by team</title>

      <description>Today’s question: What position groups have each team invested the most draft capital in over the past 10 NFL drafts (2010-2019)? I looked at overall leaguewide trends in draft capital from the last 10 years here.
This analysis might indicate that certain teams have a tendency to target certain position groups more than others. Let’s not overinterpret these results, though. Teams can bring in players through other means than the draft, such as resigning previous draftees, or signing free agents (veteran or undrafted).</description>

      <title>Assorted links, draft combine edition</title>

      <description>Today’s reading about the draft combine and the theme is that it doesn’t do very well predicting NFL performance.
As I read these studies, what really stands out is how difficult it is to measure individual player performance. A predictor can’t possibly do well if the performance measure is unreliable or not valid, and it’s clear there is a lot of be desired from the performance measures that are commonly available.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this post is to examine:
 How much draft capital has been invested in different position groups over the last 10 years? Are there trends in investment?  Sources:
 Draft history Draft pick values  Here I looked at results for the 2010-2019 drafts, covering the last 10 years. To value draft capital, I focused on the Chase Stuart model, but I report the Jimmy Johnson model results below as well.</description>

      <description>What I’ve been reading:
 On predicting individual offensive line play
 Winning leads to rushing attempts, not the other way around
   early in games, it is more important to gain yards than just to run the ball for the heck of it, but at the end of the game the number of runs is more important than how many yards they gain.
  What the nerds mean when the say running backs don’t matter…and other great bits.</description>

      <title>2020 NFL Draft Capital by Team</title>

      <description>With the Seahawks season over, I was curious to look at the current 2020 NFL draft capital of the Seahawks vs the rest of the NFL. The final draft order will not be set until after the Superbowl, but most of it is set as of today.
Here I looked at draft capital in two ways: Chase Stuart’s numbers the the older Jimmy Johnson numbers.
The Seahawks GM, John Schneider, has often traded down and generated additional picks (and surplus capital), so it would not be surprising to find him doing so again.</description>

      <title>Seahawks should pass more</title>
      <link>/2020/01/seahawks-should-pass-more/</link>

      <description>The view from my seats
 The Seahawks are known as a run first team. The numbers strongly suggest that passing more would lead to a more successful offense.
It’s well known in the analytics community that passing is generally better than rushing. See here for some examples:
 https://thepowerrank.com/2018/09/24/the-surprising-truth-about-passing-and-rushing-in-the-nfl/ https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/for-a-passing-league-the-nfl-still-doesnt-pass-enough/ https://www.cmusportsanalytics.com/nfl-expected-points-nflscrapr-part-1-introduction-expected-points/  Here I’ll review some basic analyses to make that point in general and for the Seahawks in particular for the 2019 regular season.</description>
