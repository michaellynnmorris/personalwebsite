The purpose of this post is to examine:

* How much draft capital has been invested in different position groups over the last 10 years
* How much investment in different position groups translates into performance in terms of EPA/play the following year





```{r}

#read in draft history results by position back to 2009

#load libraries
library(nflscrapR)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(na.tools)
library(rlang)
library(kableExtra)





#compare to next years EPA/play
#load the data that I previously stored so I can work with it easily
# load("/home/michael/Documents/pbp_2010_to_2019.Rda")

#look at capital by position groups, offense total, defense total, special teams





```
