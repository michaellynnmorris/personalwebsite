      <description>Some random thoughts and observations:
 Widespread mask usage seem like a good idea If we have lots of easy cheap testing (and at home), it would be much easier to allow certain people to break quarantine and possibly donate blood to help others get well. Opening up the Seattle express lanes and certain other roads to bikes seem like a great limited duration idea. They are not needed at present traffic volumes, easy to monitor/police, and provide a needed entertainment outlet with so many other parks and outdoor options closed.</description>
