<p>Pro Football Focus has a <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2020-nfl-draft-what-the-draft-tells-about-the-nfls-perception-of-positional-value">new article</a> looking at the positions that teams have spent the most draft capital on over the past few years. This is similar to what I did <a href="https://michael-morris.us/2020/01/draft-capital-by-position/">here</a> three months ago.</p>
<p>Let me review what I like about their approach and add some comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>They used their own <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/draft-2020-nfl-draft-what-the-draft-tells-about-the-nfls-perception-of-positional-value">PFF WAR</a> metric to measure draft capital of each pick. Although I don’t fully understand their approach, I like trying to quantify value in this way. In my post I looked at draft capital using Jimmy Johnson and Chase Stuart values.</li>
<li>They adjusted for the number of positions that are typically on the field at a given time to make comparing the amount invested by position simpler. For example, there is typically one and only one quarterback on the field for a given play, but there are typically at least two cornerbacks.</li>
<li>This analysis clearly shows that teams are investing a lot in running backs. As the article notes, this seems to go against what many analysts suggest, because as the saying goes running backs don’t matter.</li>
<li>PFFs results were a bit different than mine, but we agreed that teams look to be spending a bit more in recent years on quarterbacks. Beyond using a different measure of draft capital and different position groupings (e.g., they had Edge), PFF also looked at a larger range of years (2006-2020) than I did (2010-2019), perhaps that accounts for some of the differences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I’d probably trust their analysis more than mine, and it’s interesting to see the trends - passing continues to take over the league, and teams are allocating too many resources to running backs.</p>
