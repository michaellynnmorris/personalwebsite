<p>Things I’m curious to read about in the coming years about coronavirus impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work related</p>
<ul>
<li>Will companies become more friendly to remote work? Will they seek out remote employees as a form of resilience to future disease waves?</li>
<li>Will they increase their demand for office space to give their employees more space or decrease their demand as they shift to remote work?</li>
<li>Will a home office boost the value of one’s house more than before?</li>
<li>Will business travel and in person meetings become relatively less common?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Environment related
<ul>
<li>How much do air pollution levels go down? Do people notice that the air smells better?</li>
<li>How much quieter are cities without all the traffic?</li>
<li>Have numbers of wildlife increased?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>School related
<ul>
<li>Will parents become more favorable to homeschooling? Will fewer kids end up going to formal schools? Will legislation make that easier or harder to accomplish?</li>
<li>Will college students pay tens of thousands per year for remote education?</li>
<li>Will employers become less interested in college degrees as a signal of value? Will they be more open to other credentials?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lifestyle related
<ul>
<li>Will attendance at large gatherings like concerts and sporting events decline?</li>
<li>Did more people end up going to local parks? Will they continue to do so?</li>
<li>Will people eat in restaurants less?</li>
<li>Will people travel to distant locales less?</li>
<li>Will cities lose their appeal?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Health related
<ul>
<li>Will people continue to eat more beans?</li>
<li>Will bidets become more popular?</li>
<li>Will people cook more meals at home?</li>
<li>Will people focus more on home exercise options?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>My baseline overall prediction is that one year out not much changes. I remember people asking similar kinds of questions after 9/11 (will people ever fly again?) and that seems to be a distant blip on actual behavior.</p>
